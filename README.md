### Project Title
Exploring the US Bikeshare data

### Description
In this project, we will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
To answer these questions using Python, we will need to write a Python script. To help guide our work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and we will do our scripting in there also. We will need the three city dataset files too:

chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
